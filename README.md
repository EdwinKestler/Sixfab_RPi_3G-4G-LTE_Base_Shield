# Warnings

*   For the best working condition, use at least a [2A adapter](https://sixfab.com/product/official-raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/) or power source.
*   We don't recommend usage of long and low-quality micro USB cables between Base Shield and Raspberry Pi. It causes data and power loss. Thus, the cable included the package works greatly.
